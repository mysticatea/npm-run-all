### Feature Implementing

Please use GitHub Pull Requests.

There are some npm-scripts to help developments.
Those work on Windows, Mac, or Linux (by the way, I'm developping `npm-run-all` on Windows).

- **npm test** - Run tests and collect coverage.
- **npm run build** - Make `lib` directory from `src` directory.
- **npm run clean** - Delete directories (folders) which are created by other commands.
- **npm run lint** - Run ESLint.
- **npm run watch** - Run tests (not collect coverage) when each file was modified.
